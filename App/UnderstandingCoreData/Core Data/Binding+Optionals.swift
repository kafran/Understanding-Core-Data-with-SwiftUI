    /// projects the unwrapped value. If the given optional binding contains `nil`, then
    /// the supplied value is assigned to it before the projected binding is generated.
    ///
    /// This allows for one-line use of optional bindings, which is very useful for
    /// CoreData types which are non-optional in the model schema but which are still
    /// declared nullable and may be nil at runtime before an initial value has been
    /// set.

    ///         @NSManaged var name: String?

    /// - note: From experimentation, it seems that a binding created from an `@State`
    /// variable is not immediately 'writable'. There is seemingly some work done by
    /// SwiftUI following the render pass to make newly-created or assigned bindings
    /// modifiable, so simply assigning to `source.wrappedValue` inside `init` is not
    /// likely to have any effect. The implementation has been designed to work around
    /// this (we don't assume that we can unsafely-unwrap even after assigning a
    /// non-`nil` value), but a side-effect is that if the binding is never written to
    /// outside of the getter, then there is no guarantee that the underlying value will
    /// become non-`nil`.
